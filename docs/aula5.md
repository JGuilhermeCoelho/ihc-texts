# Aula 5: Need Finding (Design centrado no usuário)

## Tipos de Requisitos

A requirement is a statement about an intended product that specifies what it is expected to
do or how it will perform. For example, a requirement for a smartwatch GPS app might be
that the time to load a map is less than half a second. Another, less precise requirement might
be for teenagers to find the smartwatch appealing. In the latter example, the requirements activity would involve exploring in more detail exactly what would make such a watch
appealing to teenagers.
One of the goals of the requirements activity is to identify, clarify, and capture the requirements.
The process of discovering requirements is iterative, allowing requirements and their
understanding to evolve. In addition to capturing the requirements themselves, this activity
also involves specifying criteria that can be used to show when the requirements have been
fulfilled. For example, usability and user experience criteria can be used in this way.

Types:

Functional requirements capture what the product will do. For example, a functional
requirement for a robot working in a car assembly plant might be that it is able to place and
weld together the correct pieces of metal accurately. Understanding the functional requirements
for an interactive product is fundamental.

Data requirements capture the type, volatility, size/amount, persistence, accuracy, and
value of the required data. All interactive products have to handle some data. For example,
if an application for buying and selling stocks and shares is being developed, then the data
must be up-to-date and accurate, and it is likely to change many times a day. In the personal
banking domain, data must be accurate and persist over many months and probably years,
and there will be plenty of it.

Environmental requirements, or context of use, refer to the circumstances in which the
interactive product will operate. Four aspects of the environment lead to different types of
requirements. First is the physical environment, such as how much lighting, noise, movement,
and dust is expected in the operational environment. Will users need to wear protective
clothing, such as large gloves or headgear that might affect the choice of interface type?
How crowded is the environment? For example, an ATM operates in a very public physical
environment, thus using a speech interface is likely to be problematic.
The second aspect of the environment is the social environment. Issues regarding the social
aspects of interaction design, such as collaboration and coordination, were raised in Chapter 5,
“Social Interaction.” For example, will data need to be shared? If so, does the sharing have to be
synchronous (for instance, viewing the data at once) or asynchronous (for example, two people
authoring a report taking turns to edit it)? Other factors include the physical location of fellow
team members, such as collaborators communicating across great distances.
The third aspect is the organizational environment, for example, how good is user support
likely to be, how easily can it be obtained, and are there facilities or resources for training,
how efficient or stable is the communications infrastructure, and so on?
Finally, the technical environment will need to be established. For example, what technologies
will the product run on or need to be compatible with, and what technological
limitations might be relevant?

User characteristics capture the key attributes of the intended user group, such as the
users’ abilities and skills, and depending on the product, also their educational background,
preferences, personal circumstances, physical or mental disabilities, and so on. In addition,
a user may be a novice, an expert, a casual user, or a frequent user. This affects the ways in
which interaction is designed. For example, a novice user may prefer step-by-step guidance.
An expert, on the other hand, may prefer a flexible interaction with more wide-ranging powers
of control. The collection of characteristics for a typical user is called a user profile. Any
one product may have several different user profiles.
Usability goals and user experience goals are another kind of requirement, and they
should be captured together with appropriate measures. Chapter 2 briefly introduced

usability engineering, an approach in which specific measures for the usability goals of the
product are agreed upon early in the development process and are used to track progress as
development proceeds. This both ensures that usability is given due priority and facilitates
progress tracking. The same is true for user experience goals. Although it is harder to identify
quantifiable measures that track these qualities, an understanding of their importance is
needed during the requirements activity.

## Personas e Cenários

Personas (Cooper, 1999) are rich descriptions of typical users of the product under development
on which the designers can focus and for which they can design products. They don’t
describe specific people, but rather they are realistic, and not idealized. Any one persona
represents a synthesis of a number of real users who have been involved in data gathering,
and it is based on a set of user profiles. Each persona is characterized by a unique set of goals
relating to the particular product under development, rather than a job description or a simple
demographic. This is because goals often differ among people within the same job role or
the same demographic.
In addition to their goals, a persona will include a description of the user’s behavior,
attitudes, activities, and environment.


A scenario is an “informal narrative description” (Carroll, 2000). It describes human
activities or tasks in a story that allows exploration and discussion of contexts, needs,
and requirements. It does not necessarily describe the use of software or other technological
support used to achieve a goal. Using the vocabulary and phrasing of users means
that scenarios can be understood by stakeholders, and they are able to participate fully in
development.

Imagine that you have been asked to investigate how a design team working on a
large building project shares information. This kind of team includes several roles, such
as an architect, mechanical engineer, client, quantity surveyor, and electrical engineer. On
arrival, you are greeted by Daniel, the architect, who starts by saying something like the
following:

Every member of the design team needs to understand the overall purpose, but we
each take a different perspective on the design decisions that have to be made. For
example, the quantity surveyor will keep an eye on how much things cost, the mechanical
engineer will want to make sure that the design accounts for ventilation systems,
and so on. When the architect presents a design concept, such as a spiral staircase,
each of us will view that concept from our own discipline and assess whether it will
work as envisioned in the given location. This means that we need to share information
about the project goals, the reason for decisions, and the overall budget, as well
as drawing on our own discipline expertise to advise the client on options and consequences.

Telling stories is a natural way for people to explain what they are doing, and stakeholders
can easily relate to them.
