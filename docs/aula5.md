# Aula 5: Need Finding (Design centrado no usuário)

## Tipos de Requisitos

A requirement is a statement about an intended product that specifies what it is expected to
do or how it will perform. For example, a requirement for a smartwatch GPS app might be
that the time to load a map is less than half a second. Another, less precise requirement might
be for teenagers to find the smartwatch appealing. In the latter example, the requirements activity would involve exploring in more detail exactly what would make such a watch
appealing to teenagers.
One of the goals of the requirements activity is to identify, clarify, and capture the requirements.
The process of discovering requirements is iterative, allowing requirements and their
understanding to evolve. In addition to capturing the requirements themselves, this activity
also involves specifying criteria that can be used to show when the requirements have been
fulfilled. For example, usability and user experience criteria can be used in this way.

Types:

Functional requirements capture what the product will do. For example, a functional
requirement for a robot working in a car assembly plant might be that it is able to place and
weld together the correct pieces of metal accurately. Understanding the functional requirements
for an interactive product is fundamental.

Data requirements capture the type, volatility, size/amount, persistence, accuracy, and
value of the required data. All interactive products have to handle some data. For example,
if an application for buying and selling stocks and shares is being developed, then the data
must be up-to-date and accurate, and it is likely to change many times a day. In the personal
banking domain, data must be accurate and persist over many months and probably years,
and there will be plenty of it.

Environmental requirements, or context of use, refer to the circumstances in which the
interactive product will operate. Four aspects of the environment lead to different types of
requirements. First is the physical environment, such as how much lighting, noise, movement,
and dust is expected in the operational environment. Will users need to wear protective
clothing, such as large gloves or headgear that might affect the choice of interface type?
How crowded is the environment? For example, an ATM operates in a very public physical
environment, thus using a speech interface is likely to be problematic.
The second aspect of the environment is the social environment. Issues regarding the social
aspects of interaction design, such as collaboration and coordination, were raised in Chapter 5,
“Social Interaction.” For example, will data need to be shared? If so, does the sharing have to be
synchronous (for instance, viewing the data at once) or asynchronous (for example, two people
authoring a report taking turns to edit it)? Other factors include the physical location of fellow
team members, such as collaborators communicating across great distances.
The third aspect is the organizational environment, for example, how good is user support
likely to be, how easily can it be obtained, and are there facilities or resources for training,
how efficient or stable is the communications infrastructure, and so on?
Finally, the technical environment will need to be established. For example, what technologies
will the product run on or need to be compatible with, and what technological
limitations might be relevant?

User characteristics capture the key attributes of the intended user group, such as the
users’ abilities and skills, and depending on the product, also their educational background,
preferences, personal circumstances, physical or mental disabilities, and so on. In addition,
a user may be a novice, an expert, a casual user, or a frequent user. This affects the ways in
which interaction is designed. For example, a novice user may prefer step-by-step guidance.
An expert, on the other hand, may prefer a flexible interaction with more wide-ranging powers
of control. The collection of characteristics for a typical user is called a user profile. Any
one product may have several different user profiles.
Usability goals and user experience goals are another kind of requirement, and they
should be captured together with appropriate measures. Chapter 2 briefly introduced

usability engineering, an approach in which specific measures for the usability goals of the
product are agreed upon early in the development process and are used to track progress as
development proceeds. This both ensures that usability is given due priority and facilitates
progress tracking. The same is true for user experience goals. Although it is harder to identify
quantifiable measures that track these qualities, an understanding of their importance is
needed during the requirements activity.

### Contextual inquiry

Contextual inquiries are considered one of the richer types of user research methods, and can be a powerful tool for creating effective designs. A step further than a user interview, a contextual inquiry involves observing people in their natural context and habitat while asking them questions to fill in the gaps of your observation.

In a contextual inquiry, the UX researcher observes how participants perform certain tasks while having them describe what they are doing through their interaction with the product. 

Unlike a usability test, the user is interacting with the product in their natural habitat and context of use. This contextual environment yields richer insights and a deeper understanding behind the behavioral interaction between a user and the product. The goal is to observe the actions the users perform and understand the goals behind those actions.

## Atividades e Artefatos
(Capítulo 41, Livro 7)

### Perfil  de Usuário

(User profile)

The more designers know about the specific characteristics of a population of users (e.g., expected frequency of use, typing skill, learning styles, potential anxiety regarding the defined tasks, etc.), the more likely they will be to make optimal UX design decisions. The purpose of a user profile is thus to establish the general requirements of a category of users in terms of overall UX style and approach.


Specific user interface design alternatives that optimize the performance of some types of users may actually degrade the performance of other types of users. For example, an infrequent, casual user needs an easy-to-learn and easy-to-remember interface, but a high-frequency expert user needs an efficient, powerful, and flexible interface. Outward facing websites, unlike desktop software, share the need for an easy-to-learn interface. Even in the cases where websites have expert and frequent users, they must be accessible to new users for the site to grow. On the other hand, intranets may benefit from an interface tailored to a frequent user.

For example, a site focused on a strongly visual audience, such as professional photographers, would be better served by presenting key information using graphics rather than using primarily text. Similarly, software developer personality profiling tells us to keep messages short and direct, and to avoid “marketese” language or an overly “slick” graphical look. When software developers are led to conclusions via inductive reasoning, they are more likely to remain engaged. Similarly, credibility is established with software developers by credibly establishing a product’s acceptance by recognized experts rather than by authority figures whose reputation is not based on knowledge.


A clear understanding of the intended audience helps designers ensure a website’s ability to present its potential value to the user within 10 seconds of home page launch. Many user populations also have specific special needs that affect their ability to interact with software applications and websites. 

Exemplos: This section (Section A-Requirements Specification, in Part VI-The Development Process) covers the special characteristics of the elderly (see Chapter 35), children (see Chapter 36), cross-cultural audiences (see Chapter 39), and users with various kinds of physical and perceptual disabilities (see Chapters 38 and 40).

Personas
Personas (Cooper, 1999) - inmates are running the asylum


are rich descriptions of typical users of the product under development
on which the designers can focus and for which they can design products. 

Representação ficcional



They don’t
describe specific people, but rather they are realistic, and not idealized. Any one persona
represents a synthesis of a number of real users who have been involved in data gathering,
and it is based on a set of user profiles. Each persona is characterized by a unique set of goals
relating to the particular product under development, rather than a job description or a simple
demographic. This is because goals often differ among people within the same job role or
the same demographic.
In addition to their goals, a persona will include a description of the user’s behavior,
attitudes, activities, and environment.

Goals, aspirations and motivations - a small card

Processo/Ordem de aplicação

The user profile task is the first task in the UX engineering lifecycle.

The user profile task will feed directly into the contextual task analysis by identifying categories of users whose tasks and work environment must be studied in that later task.

Ultimately, the user profile task will have a direct impact on all design tasks, which are focused on realizing UX and business goals, which are in turn based in part on user profiles.

The user profile task will also drive the selection of UX evaluation issues and test users.

### Análise contextual de tarefas

Contextual Task Analysis

The purpose of contextual task analysis is to obtain a user-centered model of work as it is currently performed (i.e., to understand how users currently think about, talk about, and do their work in their current environment). 

In the case of e-Commerce websites, effective “persuasive” design requires an understanding of what is required to establish vendor credibility and adequate product detail. Without contextual task analysis, designers are likely to overlook important product or vendor information that may be a key to motivate users to make buy decisions. In e-Commerce website development, designers often fail to address the scope of information a visitor needs to make a buy or engagement decision as well as the level of risk a visitor may face. For example, the risks associated with choosing a family vacation, health insurance plan, or a college education vary greatly. 

In addition, in B-to-B websites, up to as many as 20 different people are involved in the buy decision (McIntosh 2011), so the role of information sharing in consensus building must be addressed. 

Beyond the actual end users themselves, the following questions needs to be addressed: what are the roles of the decision makers, what risks do they face, and what information do they require?


1. Gathering background information to define task scenarios
2. Collecting and analyzing data from observations of and interviews with users
3. Constructing and validating models of how users currently conduct tasks, which sometimes include making buy or engagement decisions

A central, key step in contextual task analysis is the second step, sometimes referred to as “contextual observations/interviews.” Here, the idea is that analysts must observe and interview users in their real-life work context to understand their needs and “hot button” motivators as well as the role of consensus in their decisions.

Scenarios
A scenario is an “informal narrative description” (Carroll, 2000). It describes human
activities or tasks in a story that allows exploration and discussion of contexts, needs,
and requirements. It does not necessarily describe the use of software or other technological
support used to achieve a goal. Using the vocabulary and phrasing of users means
that scenarios can be understood by stakeholders, and they are able to participate fully in
development.

Imagine that you have been asked to investigate how a design team working on a
large building project shares information. This kind of team includes several roles, such
as an architect, mechanical engineer, client, quantity surveyor, and electrical engineer. On
arrival, you are greeted by Daniel, the architect, who starts by saying something like the
following:

Every member of the design team needs to understand the overall purpose, but we
each take a different perspective on the design decisions that have to be made. For
example, the quantity surveyor will keep an eye on how much things cost, the mechanical
engineer will want to make sure that the design accounts for ventilation systems,
and so on. When the architect presents a design concept, such as a spiral staircase,
each of us will view that concept from our own discipline and assess whether it will
work as envisioned in the given location. This means that we need to share information
about the project goals, the reason for decisions, and the overall budget, as well
as drawing on our own discipline expertise to advise the client on options and consequences.

Telling stories is a natural way for people to explain what they are doing, and stakeholders
can easily relate to them.


Exemplo de atividade: mind mapping tool

Let’s walk through an example of how you might analyze users’ tasks as an approach to user-centric design. In this example, we are analyzing Sharon, who loves to find and save new recipes on Pinterest. 

We are going to keep this task analysis focused on the goal of shopping for ingredients and cooking a recipe found on Pinterest. If your goal is too broad, you will have a much more difficult time identifying key issues and improving the experience.

The Goal: Shop for and cook a Maple Mustard Chicken Wings recipe previously saved on Pinterest.

The diagram below shows a series of tasks and subtasks identified by watching Sharon meet the goal. We’ve also identified two tasks that required cognitive load (represented by a brain), which means these tasks required some added thinking to meet the goal. 

![aula5/t2.png](aula5/t2.png)

By analyzing the tasks shown above, we can identify repetitive and unnecessary steps and also automate steps to decrease the cognitive load required by a user.

Identifying key areas to improve the user experience: Although Pinterest is great for discovering and saving recipes, it offers no specific features that make shopping for or cooking the recipe very easy. Sharon is instead required to jump back and forth between apps and do some dreaded math (cognitive load) to convert ingredients to match her desired serving size.

Also, when she begins the cooking process, she has to repeat her initial tasks to find this recipe again after shopping from the checklist she created in the notes app.

This was a real-world example task analysis performed by Chandler Horsley, the founder of Favoreats. The Favoreats app improves on this experience while achieving the same goal by syncing to your Pinterest account and offering features to automate the many steps required to shop for and cook a Pinterest recipe. Some of these features include automatically converting measurements based on servings, and automatically creating a shopping list with added details, like which aisle you will find each ingredient in.

By understanding the users and how they previously achieved their goals, Horsley was able to identify these key areas. He was able to create a product that improved upon this existing experience without taking away the experience the users already enjoyed in the process.

It’s important, before creating a new user journey for your experience, that you develop a user research methodology and analyze the existing journey to make sure you don’t miss important needed steps and that you have the right data and perspective to solve problems that actually exist.









### Restrições e Capacidades de Plataforma

The user interface capabilities and constraints (e.g., screen size, screen resolution, browser brand and version, etc.) inherent in the technology platform chosen for the application (e.g., Apple Macintosh, MS Windows, and product-unique platforms) or website (e.g., browser brand and version) are determined and documented. These constraints will define the scope of possibilities for UX design.

Exemplos: multimedia (Chapter 17), adaptive interfaces and agents (Chapter 19), mobile devices and ubiquitous computing (Chapter 20), tangible interfaces (Chapter 21), and wearable computers (Chapter 12).
